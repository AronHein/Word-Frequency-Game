# Word Frequency Game

This is a fun little game inspired from [The Higher or Lower Game](https://www.higherlowergame.com/). The aim of the game is to guess if the given English word is used more or less on average than the other given word. The words are randomly chosen from over 10000 words. Each word comes with its definition and associated background image. Can you get the score of 10 or more ðŸ˜‰?
